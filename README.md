# 🏨 Hotel Booking Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on hotel booking data to extract meaningful insights about customer behavior, booking trends, and operational metrics.

## 📘 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to:

* Analyze hotel booking data across different cities.
* Identify patterns in booking success, room category preferences, and customer ratings.
* Support business decisions using data-driven insights.

## 📁 Files Included

* `hotels_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis, visualizations, and commentary.
* *(Optional)* `hotel_data.csv`: The dataset used (add this if you're including the dataset).
* `README.md`: This file.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

* Python 🐍
* Pandas 🐼
* NumPy 🔢
* Matplotlib & Seaborn 📊
* Jupyter Notebook 📓

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed

* Data Cleaning:

  * Handled missing values and incorrect data types.
  * Converted date columns to proper datetime format.

* Exploratory Data Analysis:

  * Grouped data by `city`, `room_category`, and `check_in_date`.
  * Analyzed `successful_bookings`, `capacity`, and `ratings_given`.
  * Visualized trends using bar plots and histograms.

* Feature Engineering:

  * Derived new insights using groupby and aggregation techniques.
  * Filled missing capacities using median values.

## 📷 Sample Visualizations

* Bar chart of booking counts by city.
* Histogram of property capacities.
* Trend analysis of check-in patterns over time.

## 📝 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hotel-booking-analysis.git
   cd hotel-booking-analysis
   ```

2. Install required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook hotels_analysis.ipynb
   ```

## ✅ Future Improvements

* Integrate machine learning to predict booking success.
* Perform sentiment analysis on reviews (if available).
* Deploy as an interactive dashboard using Streamlit or Power BI.
